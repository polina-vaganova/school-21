Summary
=======

This dataset (`ml-latest-small`) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging
activity from [*MovieLens*](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation
service.
It contains: `100836` ratings, `3683` tag applications across `9742` movies.
These data were created by `610` users between March 29, 1996 and September 24,
2018.
This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018.
Users were selected at random for inclusion.
All selected users had rated at least `20` movies.
No demographic information is included.
Each user is represented by an `id`, and no other information is provided.
The data are contained in the files: `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`,
`tags.csv`.
More details about the contents and use of all these files follows.
This is a development dataset.
As such, it may change over time and is not an appropriate dataset for shared
research results.
This and other *GroupLens* data sets are publicly available for download at
<http://grouplens.org/datasets/>.

Further information about *GroupLens*
=====================================

*GroupLens* is a research group in the *Department of Computer Science and
Engineering* at the *University of Minnesota*.
Since it's inception in 1992, *GroupLens's* research projects have explored a
variety of fields including:
* recommender systems.
* online communities.
* mobile and ubiquitious technologies.
* digital libraries.
* local geographic information systems.

*GroupLens Research* operates a movie recommender based on collaborative
filtering, *MovieLens*, which is the source of these data.
We encourage you to visit <http://movielens.org> to try it out!
If you have exciting ideas for experimental work to conduct on *MovieLens*, send
us an email at <grouplens-info@cs.umn.edu> - we are always interested in working
with external collaborators.

Content and use of files
========================

Formatting and encoding
-----------------------

The dataset files are written as
[comma-separated values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
files with a single header row.
Columns that contain commas (`,`) are escaped using double-quotes (`"`).
These files are encoded as *UTF-8*.
If accented characters in movie titles or tag values display incorrectly, make
sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or
script, is configured for *UTF-8*.

User ids
--------

*MovieLens* users were selected at random for inclusion.
Their ids have been anonymized.
User ids are consistent between `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv`.

Movie ids
---------

Only movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset.
These movie ids are consistent with those used on the *MovieLens* web site.
Movie ids are consistent between `ratings.csv`, `tags.csv`, `movies.csv`,
`links.csv`.

Ratings data file structure
---------------------------

All ratings are contained in the file `ratings.csv`.
Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie
by one user, and has the following format:
    userId,movieId,rating,timestamp

The lines within this file are ordered first by `userId`, then, within user, by
`movieId`.
Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments.
Timestamps represent seconds since midnight *Coordinated Universal Time* of
January 1, 1970.

Tags data file structure
------------------------

All tags are contained in the file `tags.csv`.
Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one
movie by one user, and has the following format:
    userId,movieId,tag,timestamp

The lines within this file are ordered first by `userId`, then, within user, by
`movieId`.
Tags are user-generated metadata about movies.
Each `tag` is typically a single word or short phrase.
The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.
Timestamps represent seconds since midnight *Coordinated Universal Time* of
January 1, 1970.

Movies data file structure
--------------------------

Movie information is contained in the file `movies.csv`.
Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the
following format:
    movieId,title,genres

Movie titles are entered manually or imported from <https://www.themoviedb.org/>
, and include the year of release in parentheses.
Errors and inconsistencies may exist in these titles.
Genres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:
* action.
* adventure.
* animation.
* children's.
* comedy.
* crime.
* documentary.
* drama.
* fantasy.
* film-Noir.
* horror.
* musical.
* mystery.
* romance.
* sci-Fi.
* thriller.
* war.
* western.
* (no genres listed).

Links data file structure
-------------------------

Identifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are
contained in the file `links.csv`.
Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the
following format:
    movieId,imdbId,tmdbId

* `movieId` is an identifier for movies used by <https://movielens.org>.
  The movie *Toy Story* has the link <https://movielens.org/movies/1>.
* `imdbId` is an identifier for movies used by <http://www.imdb.com>.
  The movie *Toy Story* has the link <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/>.
* `tmdbId` is an identifier for movies used by <https://www.themoviedb.org>.
  The movie *Toy Story* has the link <https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/862>.

Use of the resources listed above is subject to the terms of each provider.

Cross-Validation
----------------

Prior versions of the *MovieLens* dataset included either pre-computed
cross-folds or scripts to perform this computation.
We no longer bundle either of these features with the dataset, since most modern
toolkits provide this as a built-in feature.
If you wish to learn about standard approaches to cross-fold computation in the
context of recommender systems evaluation, see [LensKit](http://lenskit.org) for
tools, documentation, and open-source code examples.
